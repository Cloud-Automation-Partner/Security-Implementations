# ModSecurity Core Ruleset Configuration
# Basic configuration options

# -- Rule engine initialization ----------------------------------------------

# Enable ModSecurity, attaching it to every transaction. Use detection
# only to run ModSecurity without actually blocking anything.
# Possible values: On, DetectionOnly, Off
SecRuleEngine On

# -- Request body handling ---------------------------------------------------

# Allow ModSecurity to access request bodies. If you don't, ModSecurity
# won't be able to see any POST parameters.
SecRequestBodyAccess On
SecRequestBodyLimit 13107200

# -- Response body handling --------------------------------------------------

# Allow ModSecurity to access response bodies.
# You don't have to enable this feature, but you must if you intend to
# use any of the features that require it (e.g., content injection).
SecResponseBodyAccess On
SecResponseBodyMimeType text/plain text/html text/xml
SecResponseBodyLimit 524288

# -- Filesystem configuration ------------------------------------------------

# The location where ModSecurity stores temporary files (for example, when
# it needs to handle a request body larger than the configured limit).
#
# This location must be private to ModSecurity. You don't want other users
# on the server to access this location. For this reason, you must make sure
# that the default directory is moved to a place not accessible by other users.
# This can be done at a later stage, though.
SecTmpDir /tmp/

# The location where ModSecurity will keep its persistent data.  This default setting 
# is chosen due to all systems have /tmp available however, this is less than ideal. 
# It is recommended that this setting be reviewed and set in a more permanent location 
# on the system.
SecDataDir /tmp/

# -- File uploads handling ---------------------------------------------------

# The location where ModSecurity stores intercepted uploaded files. This
# location must be private to ModSecurity. You don't want other users on
# the server to access this location.
SecUploadDir /opt/modsecurity/var/upload/

# By default, only keep the files that were determined to be unusual
# in some way (by an external inspection script). For this to work you
# will also need at least one file inspection rule.
SecUploadKeepFiles Off

# Uploaded files are by default created with permissions that do not allow
# any other user to access them. You may need to relax that if you want to
# interface ModSecurity to an external program (e.g., an anti-virus).
SecUploadFileMode 0600

# -- Debug log configuration -------------------------------------------------

# The name of the file to which ModSecurity will write debug data.
# SecDebugLog /opt/modsecurity/var/log/debug.log

# The level of debug logging.
# SecDebugLogLevel 3

# -- Audit log configuration -------------------------------------------------

# The name of the file to which ModSecurity will write the audit log.
SecAuditEngine On
SecAuditLogParts ABIJDEFHZ
SecAuditLogType Serial
SecAuditLog /var/log/modsec_audit.log

# -- Miscellaneous -----------------------------------------------------------

# Use the most commonly used application/x-www-form-urlencoded parameter
# separator. There's probably only one application that uses this one.
# Most of the time you won't need to change this.
#SecArgumentSeparator &

# Settle on version 0 (zero) cookies, as that is what most applications
# use. Using an incorrect cookie version may open your installation to
# evasion attacks (against the rules that examine named cookies).
SecCookieFormat 0

# Specify your Unicode Code Point.
SecUnicodeMapFile unicode.mapping 20127

# Improve the quality of ModSecurity by sharing information about your
# current ModSecurity version and dependencies versions.
# The following information will be shared: ModSecurity version,
# Web Server version, APR version, PCRE version, Lua version, Libxml2
# version, Anonymous unique id for host.
SecStatusEngine On
